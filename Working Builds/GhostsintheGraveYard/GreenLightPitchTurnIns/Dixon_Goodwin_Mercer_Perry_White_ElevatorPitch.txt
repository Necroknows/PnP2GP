 Nighshade presents, Ghost Light, an adventure game where players collect mystical ingredients to break a village wide curse, while facing the constant threat of Death himself. Armed with magical weapons and potions, the player must navigate the haunted woods, ghastly graveyards , and so much more.

Main Focuses Toward Development:

*Player survival mechanics(potion crafting, stealth, speed enhancements) 
*Enemy encounters (Localized enemy system per bio / balancing combat flow )
*Continuous antagonist ( Death timer(fills on enemy kill, timer reductions with progression)
*World Exploration (set up of cohesive scenes and scene swap / grid layout processing)
*Inventory System (tracking items collected and potions / weapons on hand )
