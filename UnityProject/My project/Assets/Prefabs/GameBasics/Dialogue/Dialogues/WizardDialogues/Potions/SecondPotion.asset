  dialogue:
  - Well done apprentice! We are almost done with this dreaded curse!
  - Now, while you were out making that potion, I went out myself and tried to get
    the ingredients for the final potion.
  - Alas, I was no match for those monstrosities. Makes me wonder how you haven't
    perished out there.
  - Anyways, I dropped the recipe for the third potion while fleeing graveyard. You'll
    find it there.
  - Swiftly, apprentice. We are almost done.
