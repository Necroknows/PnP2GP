  dialogue:
  - So you need to be told, again, how things work around here. Lets continue talking
    (E) and answer me when I'm talking to you (W/S to select response, SpaceBar to
    use) this time.
  - I assume you know how to move around, yes? Well don't forget that you can double
    jump (SpaceBar) thanks to some of my modifications.
  - Because you are the apprentice of the asteemed Wizard, you have the knowledge
    to cast the spells writen in books (Left Mouse Button).
  - You also know the alchemy required to create the potions we need (Left Mouse
    Button when looking at the Water Boiler or the Mortar).
  - If you find anything interesting, interact with it (E) or pick it up (E).
  - Sometimes, things will drop from the enemies you encouter. Recovery items will
    merge with your being when you touch them. Mana can also be recovered this way.
  - While Combat is all fun and games, harm too many, and it may be you who falls
    next.
  - Now, your first quest is to gather up some Lavander for me.
  - I think that wraps up the lesson. Tell me, were you listening this time?
