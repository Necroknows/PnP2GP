  dialogue:
  - 'Well done apprentice! We are almost done '
  - Now, while you were out fetching those materials, I went out myself and tried
    to get the ingredients for the final potion.
  - Alas, I was no match for those monstrosities. Makes me wonder how you haven't
    perished out there.
  - Anyways, I dropped the last items I needed so you will have to get them.
  - Swiftly, apprentice. I almost have everything.
