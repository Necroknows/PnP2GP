  dialogue:
  - Alright, now that we have the potion, it is on to the next step.
  - I need you to go out to the graveyard and get me some Ghost Souls.
  - By now you've probably met the wraith of Death already, so I shouldn't need to
    remind you to be careful.
  - Come back to me when you have five souls and we can end this nightmare.
