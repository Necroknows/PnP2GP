  dialogue:
  - You will mostly be using E to interact with most things as well as continue the
    dialogue. You can press Left Shift to speed up the typing animation.
  - When given a choice in dialogue, W/S are to control which response is currently
    active and Space Bar is to accept the choice.
  - Naturally, WASD is to move around and space is to jump and double jump.
  - Pressing 1 or 2 will allow you to scroll through you inventory items and pressing
    q uses the currently active item.
  - To use the alchemy system, swap to your book and, using the <- and -> keys, pick
    a page for the recipe you wish to create. (the recipes do not match what they
    actually are in the system. The Legend - first page - throws it off.)
  - Once you have the desired recipe selected, use the book on the Recipe Stand to
    our right. Now the recipe for what you wish to craft is set.
  - For plant looking ingredients (Herbs), use them on the mortar to the right of
    the book. For water, use it on the boiler to the left of the book.
  - Once you have place all ingredients, press E on the stand to craft the recipe.
    If it doesn't have the neccessary ingredients, it will return them to the player's
    inventory.
  - You don't need to worry about over filling either. It will return excess items
    to you!
  - Be careful when out foraging, because killing and simply being out there draws
    death's gaze closer to you.
